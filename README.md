# AHB_to_APB-Bridge
The AHB-APB interfaces AHB and APB. It buffers address, controls, and data from the AHB, drives the APB peripherals, and return data along with response signal to the AHB. The AHB2APB interface is designed to operate when AHB and APB clocks have any combination of frequency and phase.
